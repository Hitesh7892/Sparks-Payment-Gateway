        <p class="cont1-para">Hpr groups: Helping Hands is a youth-based and youth focusing ‘not for profit organization’, founded by mr Hitesh parmar in September 2019 with Mr  Bahadur singh rawat being the co-founder. They got their initiative registered
          under societies
          Registration act in December 2019. Changing the world by merely starting an NGO can sound unrealistic but Er Hitesh parmar  follows the notion of ‘Nothing changes if nothing changes’, and motives the youth to work for the underprivileged section of
          our society with whatever they can.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Remove darkness of illiteracy</h2>
        <p>Hpr groups envisions a locality where no kid lies in the darkness of illiteracy. It dreams of a country where no child lingers palely in slums and the children are free to dream. A locality in which they celebrate their innocence instead of
          going from one house to the other, collecting garbage. These kids do possess the courage and talent to come out from where they are but the hope and the path to come out is lost. Youth must consider it as their duty to help these kids find
          a way to come out of the web of despair and have stardust in their souls.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Need for food in bellies</h2>
        <p>It’s the duty of the privileged section of the society, especially the youth, the future of the nation to help those in need. It doesn’t matter how many people you can help at a time but if a human sleeps with food in their belly on a
          particular night because of you then you are the part of a healthy cycle. You are the part of the change and no change is ever considered as small. The smiles we see on faces of the tiny tots after receiving food from us and the
          satisfaction of giving back to society is what keeps us going.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Need for Healthy Well-Beings</h2>
        <p>In urban areas, various angles of a child’s life are known to people and are generally taken care of but people living in slum areas have a different type of mindset which restricts them to take care of the education and overall
          development of their children. Developing healthy characteristics in both children and the elders is the need of the time.
          “Well-being of health is not just about being physically fit but mentally strong as well.”</p>
