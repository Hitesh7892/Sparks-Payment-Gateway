          <p class="card-text">Children were put into groups according to their prior knowledge. A group of three to four kids was appointed to each volunteer to ensure focus and prospering results. Some kids who left their schooling for some reasons
            were also encouraged to join us and resume their education. Some were hesitant to study all together but we talked them around. A bit of homework was given to them to make sure that they stay in touch with their studies. Seeing the kids
            working hard for their future made our efforts worthwhile and filled us with a sense of accomplishment.</p>

          <p class="card-text">It’s the festive season and every child deserves something special in it! October is a month of happiness and joy, filled with lots of festivals and holidays, it is one of the most awaited months of the year. It is more
            or less ironical that things that may seem ‘special’ to the children living in the slum area are just ordinary stuff for most of the children. To kids who think getting food thrice a day means having a ‘lucky day’, cloth items are like
            magic. Team Jazba decided to conduct a distribution drive in one of our adopted slum areas, Srinivaspuri, to distribute clothes to the chilren.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Happiness is real, only when it is shared!
            Team Hpr groups decided to conduct some intriguingly engaging activities for the little ones a few days before Diwali. Activities included the making of greeting cards, colouring rangolis and making lamps. The kids were very excited to use all
            the decorative materials and were taught how to use them. Colourful glitters, sheets and sketch pens were distributed amongst them. Witnessing the joyous mood of the little ones, elated ours as well</p>

          <p class="card-text">Holi not only strengthens the bond of unity but it also makes us stronger as a family, By the end of the day, the vibrant blues, pinks and yellows made every child’s vision so beautiful and unique, The Festival of
            Colours was celebrated with great enthusiasm by having a creative session of drawing and colouring with the little ones, filling their minds and life with colours of joy. Jazba also celebrated the festival of colours by distributing
            gulaal and marking their day with love and affection.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Hpr groups celebrated this Republic Day with these tiny tots. Freedom in their mind, Strength in the words, Pureness in their blood and Zeal in their hearts. It was pleasing to see them indulge in various activities with us.
            1 of our student gave a speech on Republic Day. Our celebration ended with reciting our National Anthem. </p>

          <p class="card-text">“All work, no play makes jack a dull boy”. We conducted some enthralling games for the little ones as exercise and some fun is equally as important as studying. The kids were excited to play and compete. A relaxed mind
            is a rejuvenated one and a balance scheme of work and relaxation is the proper way to keep the mind in trim shape.</p>
